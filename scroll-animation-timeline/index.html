                <time>Arrival</time> After 18 hours of flight, I finally arrived in the United States. This was my first time visiting the United States. Everything was so unfamiliar. My SIM card did work when I’m at John F. Kennedy International Airport; fortunately, I met a friendly woman who lent her phone to me. I spent one night in the hotel and then took a shuttle to LaGuardia Airport for the flight to Richmond.

                <time>Beginning of College</time> I met many international students in the first year of college. We hang out together, went to Chinese Student Association events ( Mid-Autumn Festival Barbecue and Reunion dinner ), Global office Event (Global Cafe, Virginia Trip, Hiking & Apple Picking, Thanksgiving Dinner with the local American, and Washinton DC Trip).

                <time>Hot Pot, Hot Pot, and Hot Pot…</time> In the United States, we usually get together to have dinner or Hot Pot. Because of that, I knew and ate a lot of delicious foods that I had never eaten before.

                <time>Explore Richmond</time> The Richmond Halloween Parade, The 2nd Street Festival, First Friday, Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden, Belle's Island, etc. There are a lot of events and places we can go in Richmond, and this brightens my college life.

                <time>Get involved in the VCU Community & Volunteer </time> In the college, I attended many VCU events such as Welcome Week, Intercultural Festival, Casino Night, Etiquette Dinner, Soccer game, Photoshoot at Browns Island/Canal Walk, and Community Cafe. As part of my college life, I also volunteered every Saturday in the metal studio and once in the Community Cafe. It’s nice to meet new people and learn from each other.

                <time>Covid-19 Pandemic & BLM Protest</time> I was shocked by BLM Protest in the college. Many shop windows got smashed, ATM was maliciously damaged, and bus was burned. I can see the helicopters flying in the sky. Meanwhile, Covid-19 Prandemic was so sudden. Many studio courses changed to online, and Chinese Student Association members and I packed the health kits.

                <time>Church</time> For more understanding of American culture, I went to the Christians on Campus at VCU, which hold an event called scavenger hunt for helping new arrival understand Richmond. We went hiking in Shenandoah National Park together. However, Unfortunately, I have a schedule conflict with their meeting, so I did not go to the meeting in the following semester. In my last years of college, I went to Wave Church and met many nice friendly people in Richmond. The Wave church refreshes my impression of the church.
