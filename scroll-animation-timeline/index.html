                <time>Arrival</time> After a grueling 18-hour flight, I finally touched down in the United States for my first visit. Upon arrival, I was overwhelmed by the unfamiliar surroundings. At John F. Kennedy International Airport, I encountered a technical glitch when my SIM card failed to work, but I was blessed to meet a compassionate woman who kindly offered to lend me her phone. I spent a comfortable night at a hotel and then took a convenient shuttle to LaGuardia Airport for my connecting flight to Richmond.

                <time>The Beginning of College</time> During my first year in college, I had the chance to meet a vibrant community of international students. Together, we took part in events hosted by the Global Office, including the Global Cafe, a scenic excursion to Virginia, adventurous activities like hiking and apple picking, a delightful Thanksgiving dinner with local American families, and a tour of the historic city of Washington D.C. Additionally, we also participated in events hosted by the Chinese Student Association, such as the festive Mid-Autumn Festival barbecue and a reunion dinner. These experiences allowed us to come together, build relationships, and broaden our cultural understanding.

                <time> Food </time> Hot Pot, traditional Lunar New Year dishes, and a variety of global cuisine were some of the exciting foods I had the pleasure of trying. I was able to indulge in new and delectable flavors, expanding my palate and broadening my culinary experiences. These delicious dishes added to the richness of my dining experiences and opened my eyes to the diverse gastronomic traditions of the world.

                <time>Explored Richmond</time> I'm so glad that I had the opportunity to discover the rich and diverse offerings of the city of Richmond. From the amazing Richmond Halloween Parade, to the energetic 2nd Street Festival, the awe-inspiring First Friday, the captivating Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden, the scenic Belle's Island, and more, I was constantly amazed. These engaging activities greatly enhanced my college experience, providing a window into the city's cultural heritage and diverse community.

                <time>Getting Involved in the VCU Community & Volunteering </time> I was an active participant in a range of events and activities at VCU. I attended Welcome Week, the Intercultural Festival, Casino Night, an Etiquette Dinner, a Soccer game, a photoshoot at Browns Island/Canal Walk, and the Community Cafe. Additionally, I made a habit of volunteering every Saturday in the metal studio and once in the Community Cafe. These experiences provided opportunities for me to connect with new people, gain new perspectives, and enhance my overall college experience.

                <time>Covid-19 Pandemic & BLM Protest</time> I was frightened by the BLM protest that took place on campus, marked by the destruction of shop windows and the malicious damage to an ATM and bus. In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, many of my studio courses were transitioned to online learning. Nevertheless, I felt proud to be part of the Chinese Student Association and to have contributed by packing health kits to support the community during this difficult time.

                <time>Church</time> In my effort to learn more about American culture, I joined Christians on Campus at VCU, which held a scavenger hunt to help new arrivals familiarize themselves with the city of Richmond. Unfortunately, I was unable to attend their meetings due to a scheduling conflict. During my final years of college, I attended Wave Church and met many kind and friendly people in Richmond. The Wave Church renewed my perspective on religion. Additionally, I took part in events at the First Presbyterian Church. It was a great experience to have English lessons with people from different countries. We would have dinner together and discuss current events and global affairs. After the outbreak of the Russo-Ukrainian War, some members of the First Presbyterian Church even traveled to Europe to teach English to children from Ukraine. It was an eye-opening experience to see the impact of world events so close to home.

                  I visited the college writing center to improve my writing skills and joined the Writing club. During one of the club's meetings, I tried to write a story in English but realized that my grammar skills in storytelling were lacking. To remedy this, I rewrote the story in Chinese and practiced translation. I am actively working on improving my writing abilities, with a focus on word choice, structure, and grammar. My goal is to become a more proficient and confident writer through continued practice and effort.

                  I am appreciate for the opportunity to study in the Craft and Materials Department and gain valuable skills in the process. This experience has allowed me to expand my imagination and deepen my understanding of art through artist talks, exposure to diverse works of art, and extensive reading. While my emotional perspective posed challenges during my college years, I am grateful for the lessons and growth that I have gained from these experiences. I am thankful for your patience and understanding during the past five years.
