                <time>Arrival</time> After 18 hours of flight, I finally arrived in the United States. This was my first time visiting the United States. Everything was so unfamiliar. My SIM card didn't work when I was in John F. Kennedy International Airport; fortunately, I met a friendly woman who lent her phone to me. I spent one night in the hotel and then took a shuttle to LaGuardia Airport for the flight to Richmond.

                <time>Beginning of College</time> I met many international students in the first year of college. We hang out together, went to Chinese Student Association events ( Mid-Autumn Festival Barbecue and Reunion dinner ),and Global office events (Global Cafe, Virginia Trip, Hiking & Apple Picking, Thanksgiving Dinner with the local American, and Washinton DC Trip).

                <time>Get involved in the VCU Community & Volunteer </time> In the college, I attended many VCU events such as Welcome Week, Intercultural Festival, Casino Night, Etiquette Dinner, Soccer game, Photoshoot at Browns Island/Canal Walk, and Community Cafe. As part of my college life, I also volunteered every Saturday in the metal studio and once in the Community Cafe. It’s nice to meet new people and learn from each other.

                <time>Covid-19 Pandemic & BLM Protest</time> I was shocked by BLM Protest in the college. Many shop windows got smashed,an ATM was maliciously damaged, and a bus was burned. I saw the helicopters flying in the sky. Meanwhile, Covid-19 Prandemic was so sudden. Many studio courses changed to online, and Chinese Student Association members and I packed the health kits.

                <time>Church</time> In order to learn more about American culture, I went to the Christians on Campus at VCU, which hold a scavenger hunt to help new arrivals get to know the city, Richmond. However, unfortunately, I had a schedule conflict with their meeting, so I was not able to attent the meeting in the following semesters. In my last years of college, I went to Wave Church and met many nice friendly people in Richmond. The Wave church refreshes my impression of the church. Moreover, I participate in some events in the First Presbyterian Church. It's good experience having English lessons with people from different countrie. We ate dinner together and discussed what's going on in the world and current affairs.After the Russo-Ukrainian War began, a few members of the First Presbyterian Church went to Europe to teach English to children from Ukraine.
                sAfter the Russo-Ukrainian War began, a few members of the First Presbyterian Church went to Europe to teach English to children from Ukraine. Never thought it would be so close. Thanks for your having accompanied all the way.

                  I wrote a story in the Writing club, but I'm really bad in grammar at storyteling.
                  So, I rewrote it in Chinese.

                  I learned many skills in the Craft and Materials Department, and I'm glad that I have the opportunity to study in this special art field. My imagination and impression of art are continuously refreshed by listening to the artist talk, looking at various artists' works, and reading lots of articles. It truly broadens my horizons.Although my emotional perspective view causes many problems and troubles during my college life, I feel I learned a lot through this experience. Thank you for your tolerance during the past five years.
